    <p>Project Poly is a breath of fresh air for video game enthusiasts. This first-person shooter is set in a breezy, low-poly environment presented in an abstract approach.
        This subgenre of shooter video games centres on a gun and other weapon-based combat in an immersive perspective. Player one enters the world as a single character where they
        encounter different players and challenging mobs in a race to the top of the leaderboard.</p>
    <p>The fast-paced and naturally lit environment presents a warm introduction for enthusiastic gamers (15+) as they progress in kill numbers for the overall result of a combat
        score. Improve your skills and mechanics whilst playing this game, all whilst having fun!</p>
    <p>Project Poly has been planned and developed with consideration of previous FPS players who are looking for something different to play, or new PC players who want to try#
        omething entertaining to occupy their time. The bright environment and the busy movement of enemies and mobs, players will never be bored in their epic combat.</p>
    <p>Bright blue skies, and green grass. The best place to have the ultimate battle with your enemies. Hide behind the trees, or jump through the waterfall. Anywhere is a
        battleground, and yours to take.</p>

    <p>Computer games have always been an interest that I have strong passion towards, from as early as primary school. Having my mum's laptop allowed me to play games with friends
        from school. This became an interest that I grew passionate towards when I got my first laptop at the end of primary school.</p>
    <p>The games design course I am taking consists of written and practical coursework, which encourages creativity and productivity in and outside of class. I like to use unreal
        engine and have started learning it to create my FPS game towards my vocational grade at the end of the academic year. I have done blueprinting, animating, and modelling in
        relevance to my level design. Currently for my course I am working on animating the character in the game and making a functional gunplay experience.</p>
    <p>Studying games design at a degree level would be an extremely huge and exciting step for me as I want to get in this industry. I play games often and therefore know and can
        incorporate the fundamentals into my work. Once I am set something, I am determined to complete the task to the best standard.</p>
    <p>Even though I have to work alone for my coursework, I am also able to work effectively as a team and I love exploring and sharing ideas within a group towards a project. My
        communication skills have improved over the years and I am able to express my thoughts to others in a beneficial manner.</p>
    <p>Throughout my education I have become familiar with Python, JavaScript, Python, and CSS, and think that these languages are important to learn towards making games. I have
        looked at C#, however, have not gone into detail with the programming language.</p>
